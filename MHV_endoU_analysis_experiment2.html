<h3>Discussion of coverage analysis:</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We do not observe significant capture of MHV RNA from any of the mock infected samples</li>
<li>In general, we see more MHV “cleavage” (aka 2´,3´-cyclic phosphate capture) at 12 hpi vs. 9 hpi with WT virus, which may reflect greater viral RNA abundance at the later time point.</li>
<li>There is less signal in the viral samples infected with mutant nsp15, which may reflect decreased viral RNA abundance.</li>
<li>The IFNAR KO and RNaseL KO samples are similar, but different. This may reflect direct vs. infdirect effects of dsRNA sensing pathways and effectors on MHV detection.</li>
<li>Overall, the patterns between experiment 1 and experiment 2 are similar, except that there seems to be more cleavage in RNaseL KO and nsp15 mutant + strand RNA in experiment 2 than experiment 1. This doesn’t make a lot of sense considering that in the abscence of both RNaseL and Nsp15 there should be less cleavage of viral RNA and this was observed in experiment 1.</li>

<h1>Identifying “significant” sites of nsp15 cleavage</h1>
<p>This analysis calculates which potential cleavage sites have the greatest fold change in cleavage signal between samples infected with WT virus and samples infected with nsp15 mutant virus. Cleavage sites where signal captured during WT infection decreases the most during infection with nsp15 mutant virus may be “real” sites of MHV endoU cleavage acitivity.</p>
<p>Calculating “fold change” across all sites is an unbiased approach to identify potential nsp15 cleavage sites. An alternative approach, focuses on fold change at sites with the greatest signal in the libary.</p>

<p>The overall pattern of cleavage for the top 50 sites by normalized count is similar between experiment 1 and experiment 2. However, in experiment 2 there is more signal in nsp15 infections (both WT and RNaseL KO cells) which suggests there is more non-specific cleavage of the viral RNA in this experiment.</p>

<h2>Fold-change for RNaseL</h2>
<p>In this analysis, all positions in the MHV positive strand RNA with more than 20 reads were queried to identify sites with equal to or greater than a 5-fold decrease in signal comparing B6 WT cells to RNaseL KO cells (B6/RNaseL).</p>
<p>This analysis is independent of viral infection and just asks which sites change the most when RNaseL is absent.</p>

<p>There are 2 important observations from this data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There are more sites with greater than 5-fold decrease in signal in experiment 2 and the fold-change ranges are generally higher. This relates to the fact that I was able to find many overlapping sites comparing experiment 1 to experiment 2. However, less of these sites in experiment 2 were also captured in exp. 1</p></li>
<li><p>In exp.2 there were no sites captured during nsp15 infection with a greater than 5-fold decrease in signal in the abscence of RNaseL. In exp.1, there were very few sites captured. This strongly suggests that abscence of nsp15 leads altered RNaseL activity.</p></li>

<h2>Fold-change for Nsp15 mutant reads</h2>
<p>In this analysis, all positions in the MHV positive strand RNA with more than 20 reads were queried to identify sites with equal to or greater than a 5-fold decrease in signal comparing cells infected with WT/ns2 mutant virus to nsp15 mutant virus (MHV WT/nsp15 and ns2/nsp15).</p>
<p>This analysis is independent of cells type and just asks which sites change the most when nsp15 activity is lost. Thus, these sites are not independent of RNaseL actviity.</p>

<p>In this analysis, the patterns of cleavage between experiment 1 and 2 are very similar. There are less sites with greater than 5-fold decrease in cleavage during infection with nsp15. However, 8 of the top 10 sites by fold-change identified in exp.1 were also captured in exp.2.</p>
<p>Exp.2 also furthur emphasizes that loss of RNaseL results in decreased cleavage by nsp15. Additionally, the ns2 mutant also alters cleavage of MHV RNA as compared to WT virus.</p>

<p>This analysis reveals some of the biggest differences between exp.1 and exp.2; in experiment 1 there were 35 sites captured in RNaseL KO cells with a greater than 5-fold decrease in signal with nsp15 infection. However, only 5 sites were detected in exp.2 and none of these were captured in experiment 1. This may be related to the higher level of cleavage signal observed in RNaseL KO cells infected with nsp15 in experiment 2 relative to experiment 1.</p>

<p>There are overlapping positions of “significant” nsp15-dependent cleavage by normalized count and fold change analysis between the 2 experiemnts in B6 WT cells. This does not hold true for these analyses in RNaseL KO cells where there are almost no significant cleavages in experiment 2 under infection with WT cells. There are only 5 sites with a greater than 5-fold change in the abscence of nsp15 that are nsp15 dependent and RNaseL independent in exp.2, while experiment 1 had 35. None of the sights from experiment 2 were identified in experiment 1.</p>

<h3>Discussion of dinucleotide analysis</h3>
<p>Experiment 2 is mostly consistent with the dinuclotide analysis from experiment 1. The most prominent cleavages are still consistent with known RNaseL dinucleotide preferences, UA and UU, especially predomiannt in the ns2 mutant virus infection.</p>
<p>In the general analysis, there is a overall preference for U &gt;&gt;&gt; C &gt;&gt; A &gt; G. The RNaseL specific analysis identifies UA as the predominantly cleaved dincleotide, which is also consistent with experiment 1. In the nsp15 focused analysis, in the B6 WT cells with WT virus there is a preference for pyrimidine cleavage. But, this pattern is disrupted in the ns2 mutant infection and in the RNaseL KO cells.</p>
