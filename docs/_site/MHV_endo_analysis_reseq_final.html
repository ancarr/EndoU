<h3>Discussion of coverage analysis:</h3>
<p>Overall, most of the patterns observed in the inital analysis are observed in this data. We capture the most cleavage in the MHV (+) strand RNA and this signal decreases in B6 WT samples infected with mutant nsp15 virus. In the RNase L KO samples, we overall capture less signal in the MHV RNA, as initally observed. There are some low freuqency signals in the RNase L KO samples infected with WT virus that do seem to decrease in the nsp15 mutant infection.</p>

<h3>Discussion of fold change analysis:</h3>
<p>Overall, the results are similar to the inital analysis. However, the relative fold change values for each site seem to differ somewhat due to increased or decreased signal capture upon reseuqnecing. In fact, there seem to be some sites that are no longer sigfificantly decreased in this analysis.</p>
<p>However, in general the dinucleotides observed at the sites with the greatest fold decrease in signal are similar to those initally observed. Additionally, this data continutes to support that observation that site speciifc cleavage seems to differ between cell type signficiantly. In this data, there seems to be less overlap of significnatly decreased sites between the WT B6 and RNase L KO cells.</p>

<h3>Discussion of dinucleotide analysis</h3>
<p>Overall, the patterns in this analysis are very similar to those initally described. An increase in RNase L dependent cleavage at UA, UU, and also UG is observed in B6 cells infected with mutant nsp15 virus, which is consitent with the idea of increased RNase L activation in the abscence of nsp15 activity. Conversely, signal at AC, CC, GC, UC, AU, CU, GU decreases in the abscence of nsp15 activity.</p>
<p>While there appears to be a specific dinucleotide preference pattern in the B6 cells that is altered by loss of nsp15 activity, this pattern is less clear in the RNase L KO cells. In these cells, there is are only small differences in dinucleotide frequencies between cells infected with WT virus and nsp15 virus. The nsp15-depdendent freuqnecies from the substarctive analysis reveal a similar patterning in the B6 cells, but complete loss of this patterning in the RNase L KO samples.</p>
