title: "Using 2´,3´-Cyclic Phosphate Sequencing to Identify MHV nsp15 RNA Targets"
---

This website contains analysis of mouse macrophage RNAs and MHV RNA in order to identify targets of the MHV endoribonuclease nsp15. We analyzed MHV RNA, ribosomal RNA, and mRNA to identify potential targets. While we do detect some potential sites of cleavage in MHV RNA and ribosomal RNA, many of these sites are inconsistently dectected across cell types and occur at very low frequency. Furthermore, a clear sequence context that directs cleavage was not identifed in these inital analyses. If specific  sites can be narrowed down for further investigation, a directed motif analysis may reveal a sequence preference. 

The data and brief discussions of the results are organized as seperate pages for each of the types of RNAs analyzed, which can be accessed in the menu at the top of this webpage. It would be best to start with the analysis of the MHV RNA and move down the list.
