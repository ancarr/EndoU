<h1>Identify RNAs with the most abundant capture of 2´,3´- cyclic phosphates across all samples.</h1>
<p>In this analysis, the total and normalized counts per RNA were summed and filtered to exclude RNAs with less than 100 total reads and less than 5 reads per position. Additionally, an analysis to detect RNA reads unique to infected samples was performed to interogate RNA cleavage that may be dependent upon nsp15.</p>
